(In Git)

 === New features 
  * Added matcher for checking if a collection of emails includes an email with a particular subject (Luke Melia, Noah Davis)
  * Introduced hook to convert objects to email addresses (Luke Melia and Lee Bankewitz)

    This allows you, in your step matcher, to say something like:
    maillbox_for(some_user)

    Use it in your cucumber env.rb like so:

      EmailSpec::AddressConverter.instance.conversion do |input|
       if input.is_a?(User)
         input.email
       else
         input
       end
      end

=== Bufixes
 * Isolated variances between using email-spec with an ARMailer project. (Luke Melia)
